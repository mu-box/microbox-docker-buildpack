# For Heroku emulation, we need to export a DATABASE_URL
#
# Fortunately, heroku is pretty simple and most apps are
# assumed to have a single database, either postgres or
# mysql. Since Microbox is much more flexible than Heroku,
# we need to make a few assumptions to dumb it down for
# heroku emulation. We are going to assume that if they're
# trying to run a heroku-like app, then they will have
# added a database and named it postgres, or mysql.
# If either of those are true, we'll export them as the
# database_url
